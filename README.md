# S7-PLC - Base64

Base64 encoding and decoding of strings for Siemens PLCs S7-1200 and S7-1500.

I have tested this with TIA v14 and later. Though they also might work with the
S7-300 and the classic SIMATIC Manager

The functions work with strings, so you will have to convert your actual decoded
bytes first.
